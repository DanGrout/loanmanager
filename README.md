## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (if running locally)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd loanmanager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL using Docker
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Run database migrations
   pnpm prisma migrate dev
   
   # Seed the database (optional)
   pnpm prisma:seed
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   # Database Configuration
    POSTGRES_USER=loanmanager
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=loanmanager123
    POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
    POSTGRES_PORT=5433
    POSTGRES_DB=loanmanager
    
    # Node Environment
    NODE_ENV=development
    
    # This was inserted by `prisma init`:
    # Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
    # See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema
    
    # Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
    # See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings
    
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/loan_manager?schema=public"
   ```

   > **Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration values. Never commit the `.env` file to version control.

5. Configure environment-specific settings:
   - For development: Use the values above
   - For production: Use secure, production-grade values
   - For testing: Use test-specific values
